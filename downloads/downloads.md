This page contains released versions of the Z80 Disassembler.

## Version 1.0.0:
This is an initial version which suits my personal needs. Future updates and/or bug fixes may become available upon request.

Known limitations:
* Input file must have ".bin" extension.
* Input file must be in binary format.
* Binary code is assumed to be Z80 compatible.
* Start address is assumed to be 0x0000.
* Output file appears in same folder as input file.
* Output file has same filename as input file.
* Output file has ".lst" extension.
* Output file is in listing format (no assembler compatible input as it includes address and binary code).

## Usage:
Download one of the executable jar files to a local folder.
In order to use the disassembler you need a Java runtime.
See README.md in the root folder for usage instructions.
